# Object-oriented Programming: Assessment

## Brief

This is a research assessment, hence no programming required for this assessment. This assessment aims to clarify your conceptual understandings in OOP concepts and bridging these concepts to a context (actual implementation).

We have learned the following OOP concepts:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

You are to explain these concepts in your own words and produce an argument for a specific actual scenario where these concepts can be applied. The application can be a single or multiple concepts to a scenario. Your research channel is Google - search for real life use cases for OOP Concepts.

You are to give a minimum of 500 words for each question [here](./assessment.md).

## Submission

You are required to submit your assignment to black board.

- Cite any relevant sources consulted during your research
- Solve the problems using your own code
- Do not copy and paste solutions from the source material
