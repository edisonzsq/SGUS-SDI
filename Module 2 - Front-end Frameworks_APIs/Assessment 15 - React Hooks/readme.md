# React Hooks: Assessment

## Brief

This is a research and reflection assessment where you are to answer this problem statement: Should one choose to use purely class or functional components?

There is such argument on [this topic](https://medium.com/wesionary-team/react-functional-components-vs-class-components-86a2d2821a22). There is not quite an absolute answer but you should start formulating your own.

Excerpt from link:

> 1. Functional Components also known as Stateless component
> 2. Class Component also known as Stateful component
