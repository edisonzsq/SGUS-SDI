# Class Component States & Life Cycle: Lesson

## Brief

In this lesson, only the class component is covered. We will cover functional component and hooks the next lesson.

Sample code is prepared for you in the `instructor` folder. It is recommended that you code from scratch.

### Part 1 - Initializing and updating state.

Refer to this [file](./instructor/lesson-2.7-app/src/components/StateDemo.js).

Demonstrate those codes that are commented `Part 1`. Includes `onKeyUp` event handling.

There will be complex code such as `this` and `bind()`. You will be confronted with the knowledge of ES6 class. 


### Part 2 - Implementing `componentDidUpdate()`

With the same code base as Part 1 `componentDidUpdate()` is invoked whenever there is a change to the state.

Refer to this [link](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount) to learn more about the three parameters.


### Part 3 - Implementing `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount`

Refer to this the [Parent](./instructor/lesson-2.7-app/src/components/part-3-demo/Parent.js) and [Child](./instructor/lesson-2.7-app/src/components/part-3-demo/Child.js).
