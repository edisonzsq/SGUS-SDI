# Components & Props: Lesson

## Instructor's Note

Instructors are to code from scratch. Give learners 1 minute to setup project with `npx create-react-app comp-app`.

In this lesson, prepare a directory `./src/components` and create all components within this folder.


### Part 1 - Create a class component.

Remove the JSX in App.js and replace it with `<Parent>` component.

An sample of a class component is located [here](./instructor/comp-app/src/components/Parent.js).

### Part 2 - Create second class component and pass a props.

The sample of second class component with a passed props is [here](./instructor/comp-app/src/components/Child.js).

### Part 3 - Create functional component within a class component and as standlone JS file.

Refer to the same [Parent.js](./instructor/comp-app/src/components/Parent.js) for functional components declared within.

Refer to [ThirdSibling.js](./instructor/comp-app/src/components/ThirdSibling.js) as a standalone functional component.

### Part 4 - Use props in functional component

In the same standalone [functional component](./instructor/comp-app/src/components/ThirdSibling.js), a prop is passed.
