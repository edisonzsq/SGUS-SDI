# Agile SCRUM: Assignment

## Brief

There are two parts to this assignment. 

In part 1, you are to set up a task tracker platform with you group. As your project week is drawing near, the task tracker platform will allow you to setup product backlog and sprint backlog.

In part 2, you are to venture into research online, engage in group discussion and then produce a personal conclusion for submission.

## Part 1 - Setup Task Tracker

You are recommended to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for quick and simple setup. Everyone should create an account on Trello, but only one of you are required to setup the board (don't choose from template, just create a new board) and share the board with the rest of the group members. 

Once you are done, setup 5 columns:
1. Backlog (to add)
1. To Do (default)
1. Doing (default)
1. Reviewing (to add)
1. Done (default)

The result of it should look like this:
