# Agile SCRUM: Assignment

## Brief

There are two parts to this assignment. 

In part 1, you are to set up a task tracker platform with you group. As your project week is drawing near, the task tracker platform will allow you to setup product backlog and sprint backlog.

In part 2, you are to venture into research online, engage in group discussion and then produce a personal conclusion for submission.

## Part 1 - Setup Task Tracker

You are recommended to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for quick and simple setup. Everyone should create an account on Trello, but only one of you are required to setup the board (don't choose from template, just create a new board) and share the board with the rest of the group members. 

Once you are done, setup 5 columns:
1. Backlog (to add)
1. To Do (default)
1. Doing (default)
1. Reviewing (to add)
1. Done (default)

The result of it should look like this:

## Part 2 - Research and Discuss

__Reflect on the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), phrase them in no more than five sentences in your own words.__

```
The manifesto prioritises:
- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- a working software over comprehensive documentation
- continuous collaboration with customers over contract negotiation
- expecting changes and responding to them over following a plan
```
\
\
\
__Agile Methodology does not just apply to software development but any project management. Recollect the 12 principles of Agile and share which three principles are commonly violated in your experience and what can be done differently?__

| **Principles commonly violated** | **What can be done differently** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|1. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a **constant pace** indefinitely.| Can be overcome through early planning of project backlog, which enables pacing through sprint backlogs and lists of things to be done.|
|2. |   |
\
\
\
__What are the three roles that make up a SCRUM Team? Explain the function(s) of the three roles.__

```
3 roles: Product owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
```
| **Roles in a SCRUM Team** | **Functions associated with the role** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Product Owner** | - Manages the Product Backlog\ - Optimizes the value of the Product |
| **Scrum Master** | - Manages the Scrum process\ - Removes any hindrances/ impediments to project progression |
| **Development Team** | - Manages itself \ - Creates "Done" Increments|
\
\
\
__What are the SCRUM Values?__

```
5 values: Commitment, Focus, Openness/ Transparency, Respect, Courage
```
- **Commitment** to delivering working software
- **Focus** on what is the most important
- **Openness** (frequent inspection) through delivering
- **Respect** others and their roles: cross-functioning, self-organizing team
- **Courage** to admit that we do not know everything
\
\
\
__How many types of meetings are there in SCRUM? What is the purpose of each of them?__
```
Three types: Daily scrum meeting, sprint planning meeting, retrospective review.
```
- **Daily Scrum**: daily meeting for accountability, and daily update of what has been done the last 24 hours, what will be done in the next 24 hours, and identification of any blockers (things that are hindering progress).
- **Sprint Planning**: meeting once a fortnight to plan for next tasks for next Sprint. 
- **Retrospective Review**: meeting at end of each Sprint to reflect on what worked well, what could be improved upon and how, as well as commitments/ an action plan to implement improvement suggestions.
