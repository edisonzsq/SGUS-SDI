# Agile SCRUM: Assignment

## Brief

There are two parts to this assignment. 

In part 1, you are to set up a task tracker platform with you group. As your project week is drawing near, the task tracker platform will allow you to setup product backlog and sprint backlog.

In part 2, you are to venture into research online, engage in group discussion and then produce a personal conclusion for submission.

## Part 1 - Setup Task Tracker

You are recommended to use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for quick and simple setup. Everyone should create an account on Trello, but only one of you are required to setup the board (don't choose from template, just create a new board) and share the board with the rest of the group members. 

Once you are done, setup 5 columns:
1. Backlog (to add)
1. To Do (default)
1. Doing (default)
1. Reviewing (to add)
1. Done (default)

The result of it should look like this:

## Part 2 - Research and Discuss
\
&nbsp;
**Reflect on the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), phrase them in no more than five sentences in your own words.**

```
The manifesto prioritises:
- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- a working software over comprehensive documentation
- continuous collaboration with customers over contract negotiation
- expecting changes and responding to them over following a plan
```

\

**Agile Methodology does not just apply to software development but any project management. Recollect the 12 principles of Agile and share which three principles are commonly violated in your experience and what can be done differently?**

| **Principles commonly violated** | **What can be done differently** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|1. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a **constant pace** indefinitely.| **Early planning** of project backlog, which enables pacing through sprint backlogs and lists of things to be done.|
|2. Build projects around **motivated** individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.| **Get everyone onto the same page** and ensure that their **concerns are addressed** so that everyone can be working towards the same goal on the agenda with a personal purpose behind achieving the goal. **Respect each individual's roles** and maintain a friendly culture for asking and receiving help whenever required. | 3. Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project. | **Manage and clarify expectations** before embarking on project that each working day should start with a short meeting to update relevant stakeholders or parties on the status and progress of project (including blockers). |

\

**What are the three roles that make up a SCRUM Team? Explain the function(s) of the three roles.**

```
3 roles: Product owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
```
| Roles in a SCRUM Team | Functions associated with the role |
|       :------:        |------------------------------------|
| **Product Owner** | - Manages the Product Backlog<br/>- Optimizes the value of the Product |
| **Scrum Master** | - Manages the Scrum process<br/>- Removes any hindrances or impediments to project progression |
| **Development Team** | - Manages itself<br/>- Creates "Done" Increments|

\
&nbsp;

**What are the SCRUM Values?**

```
5 values: Commitment, Focus, Openness/ Transparency, Respect, Courage
```
- **Commitment** to delivering working software
- **Focus** on what is the most important
- **Openness** (frequent inspection) through delivering
- **Respect** others and their roles: cross-functioning, self-organizing team
- **Courage** to admit that we do not know everything

\
&nbsp;

**How many types of meetings are there in SCRUM? What is the purpose of each of them?**

```
Three types: Daily scrum meeting, sprint planning meeting, retrospective review.
```
| Types of SCRUM Meetings | Purpose of Meeting |
|       :------:          |--------------------|
| **Daily Scrum** | **Daily meeting** for accountability, and daily update of what had been done the last 24 hours, what will be done in the next 24 hours, and identification of any blockers (things that are hindering progress).
| **Sprint Planning** | **Meeting once a week/fortnight/month (depending on duration of a Sprint)** to plan for next tasks for next Sprint. 
| **Retrospective Review** | **Meeting at end of each Sprint** to reflect on what worked well, what could be improved upon and how, as well as commitments or an action plan to implement the suggestions for improvement.
