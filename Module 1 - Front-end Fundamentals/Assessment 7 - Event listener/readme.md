# Event Listener: Assessment

## Brief

You are required to write a simple form submission task on scratch. Within `<form>` tag, you should have the information of a typical National Registration Identity Card (NRIC).

1. Legal name
1. Date of birth
1. Identity card no.
1. Race
1. Sex
1. Country of birth

When user click on "Submit" button, an alert will be raised with the above listed information.

Since this lesson is about event listener, your assessment only require you to submit task up to this point. See below for additional code challenge if you would like to challenge yourself.

## Additional Code Challenge

### Challenge 1

You may attempt form validation. In a live project, every form submission requires validation to ensure that user input is according to the expected "rules". For example, we should only accept a legit "race". If somebody enter "alien", an error message should ber raised.

### Challenge 2

Explore the use of other input fields. Refer to this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) to learn more about other possible input field type. 

### Challenge 3

To help user fill in all input fields at ease, we should allow them to use "tab" key to move to the next field. This means that you have to predefine the order of input fields so that when "tab" key is detected in any input field, you would move focus to the next one. All input fields should call the same function to shift focus to the next field.
