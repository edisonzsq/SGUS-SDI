# Class Component State & Life Cycle: Assessment

## Brief

The objective of this assessment aims to complement the practical exercises you have done in lesson and assignment. In the lesson, you have faced certain complex syntax such as `this`, `.bind()` and `{}` in JSX. Let's dive a little more to understand what are these all about. Let the questions in this assessment guide you through your research.
