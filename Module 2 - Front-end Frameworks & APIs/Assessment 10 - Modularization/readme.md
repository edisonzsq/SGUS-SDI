# Modularization: Assessment

## Brief

Modularization in the context of JavaScript are codes written in separate JS files. Some of these files are part of your local project, while some are external module that are being downloaded using a Node Packaging Manager (NPM). To date (1 Aug 2020), there are two ways to import modules - CommonJS and ES6.

In this assessment, you will be demonstrating the ability to import dependencies from both local and external modules, as well as using CommonJS and ES6 approach.

Check out specific instruction at respective JS files:
- [Common JS](./commonjs/index.js)
- [ES6](./es6/index.js)
- [NPM](./npm-approach/index.js)

## Submission Guidelines

- Cite any relevant sources consulted during your research
