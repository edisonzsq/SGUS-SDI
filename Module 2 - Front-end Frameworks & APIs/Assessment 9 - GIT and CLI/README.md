# GIT & CLI: Assessment

## Brief

In actual projects, developers may be required to write documentations to assist support engineers or operations engineer in deploying project. In this assessment, you are to write such a documentation that should be clear to the reader on the actionables required to deploy a project (a folder).

You are to write a documentation that contain CLI Commands to:
1. Move [this folder](./Main) from where it is now to the home directory.
1. Delete the folder `folder_c` after moving to the home directory.
1. Rename `Folder A` to `folder-a`.
1. Copy `folder-b` to `folder-a` (to achieve `./Main/folder-a/folder-b`).

Input the CLI Commands here.

    ## Move main folder to the home directory
    ```
    

    ```
    ## Delete folder_c after moving to the home directory
